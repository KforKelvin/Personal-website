	Creating an optimized production build...
	One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
	"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
	declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
	"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
	node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.
	
	babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
	is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
	ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
	your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
	go away.
	  
	
	Treating warnings as errors because process.env.CI = true.
ost CI servers set it automatically.
